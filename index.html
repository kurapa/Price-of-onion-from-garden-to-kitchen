				Onions are an important food in India, not 
				just for their broad culinary uses, but also 
				because their price swings can influence 
				political outcomes. The root vegetable is 
				treated almost as a staple food, for its 
				flavor and for its nutrients. India is the world’s second-largest producer of onions, after China. Even though India consumes and produces a great deal of onions, it has had considerable trouble smoothing out eye-watering price volatility. In various major Indian cities, retail prices of onions more than quadrupled between May 2018 and October 2018, in which retail prices nearly doubled before falling back down.
				Although the onion prices increase in a rapid rate in markets, it mostly brings only tears in the eyes of farmers who cultivate them. How much ever the price may be, the farmers are paid only a little, that is never enough for the investment on the crop and the family requirement.

		<!--Field Study-->
		<div id="field" class="section">
			<h1>&#x1F9C5 Field Study </h1><br>
			<div class="text-justify">
				<img src="../ASSERTS/field1.jpg" alt="Field" width="750px" height="500px" style="float:left;padding-right: 20px;">
				The farm land we went for field study belongs to a 
				small-scale farmer, Mr.Senthriyan. It was a 
				medium-large farm covered with onion bulbs.  
				The onion bulbs were big  and their tops began 
				to turn yellow and fall over. The farmer said that, 
				it was the time, when the onion bulbs are ready 
				to get harvested. Then we asked the farmer about 
				the procedure being followed  by him to grow onions.<br><br> 
				He said that, onions are those plants that need 
				abundant supply of sunlight and water. Onions roots
				are shallow and not very efficient at taking up moisture,
				so they need a steady supply of water to grow without 
				interruption. Although they actually recover well from 
				drought and start growing again when watered, it is best to 
				keep the soil consistently moist until the bulbs enlarge. 
				So, overcrowding of seeds while sowing should be strictly 
				avoided.  He then added that, the soil should be tilted at 
				least 4-6 times before sowing. After that, the seeds should 
				be constantly supplied with water at regular intervals.   
				When he was asked about the insects attacking the onion bulbs, 
				he  said that yellowish-white insects or thrips attack the onion 
				bulbs by living in their leaves and slowly eating up the minerals 
				being supplied to the onions. 
				He also added that, a nitrogen-based fertilizer along with some 
				insecticides were sprayed around 
				the base of the onion bulb just before 14 days of our visit, 
				using a garden hose. When we asked him about the fertilizers 
				they use in the farm, we got answer that, the nitrogen-based fertilizer sprayed to control thrips is itself enough to support the growth of onions. 
				<br><br>Then, we asked him about harvesting the onions. He said, “For full-sized bulbs, the onions
				should grow and mature. As said before, they are ready to harvest when the bulbs are big and the tops begin to turn yellow and fall over. Pull them up, shake off the soil, and lay them out to cure with the tops still attached. Any warm, airy location is a good place to do this; we can even sling them over a fence as long as they aren’t rained upon. Bulbs must stay dry and
				have good air circulation. As the onions cure, the 
				roots will shrivel and the necks above the bulbs will slowly dry – a natural process that helps to seal the top of the bulb, making the onions less likely to rot. After 7 to 10 days, clip off the tops of the onions and the roots with pruning shears, remove as much dry dirt as possible without taking off the papery outer skins, and store the onions in a cool place.”
				<br><br><img src="../ASSERTS/field2.jpg" alt="Field" width="750px" height="500px" style="float:right;padding-left: 20px;padding-top: 20px;">
				When we asked him about the profits he gain                                                                             from onions, he said, “The prices of onions will 
				be very low when they are bought by the onion 
				dealers from the farmers. As the produce shift 
				hands, the price starts growing to such a extent 
				that when the onion reaches to the kitchen of 
				customers, the price will be at least thrice the 
				price brought from him,  (i.e), farmers. According 
				to the price of the dealer, if I sell my produce today I will get only Rs.10,000 to Rs.15,000 for the whole produce which weighs about 40 sacks of 25Kg each. Therefore, I get only Rs.10 to Rs.15 per Kg. 
				The same produce when you buy in the market, you should buy for not less than Rs.40 or Rs.45. This gives me only a little profits or sometimes even not that. After paying debt to the moneylender, I will be left with only a little that is sufficient for the next time investment.  Moreover, if I sell this produce during next month, since the demand for onions is very less, I will get paid only Rs.3 to Rs.10 per Kg. This gives me either a loss or the investment and never a profit of at least Rs.1. When I grow during the time of Nov-Dec, the cyclones will show a great effect on my produce which will, give not more than half of the investment.”

		<!--Story Of Farmer-->
		<div id="story" class="section">
			<h1>&#x1F9C5 Story Of Farmer </h1><br>
			<div class="text-justify">
				<img src="../ASSERTS/story.png" alt="Ponpandian" width="450px" height="450px" style="float:right;padding-left: 20px;">
				We then visited a poor family of Ponpandian in a nearby locality of the farm. We asked the wife of Ponpandian, Mrs. Aramalar, about their family. Then she said, “My family consisted of my husband, Mr.Ponpandian, our two daughters, Kavya and Bhoomi, who are 21 and 18 years respectively. Our elder daughter completed her B.A and was to get married. My husband, who was a small farmer who used to cultivate onions,  borrowed Rs.5 lakhs from a moneylender, Mr. Arumurugam, with the interest of 8%, for the expenses of our elder daughter’s marriage. With great effort, with the money borrowed and money saved by us, we got our elder daughter married. In the very next year, the cyclone brought a great loss to our produce. We got nearly 50% less than the investment. On the other hand, the moneylender started to ask the interest for the money borrowed. At last, we sold our one and only land and thought of paying the whole debts. But, it was only enough to pay the interest. Having no land left, my husband and I searched for many jobs, but were unsuccessful at every search. Soon, there came a situation, when we didn’t get even one-time meal. With the situation, my husband hanged himself and suicided, just for the sake of relief fund we will get from the government and that could help the survival of my daughter and myself. The fund was enough only to pay the debts borrowed from the moneylender.  Now, I go for labour in the moneylenders farm and also for household work in the houses of other richer people. My elder daughter also send us money enough for the education of my younger daughter.” 
				<br><br>The moneylenders who are already rich get even richer by exploiting the poor peasants (farmers). And the poor peasant only get even poorer. Even during such situation, there will be no hands to save his family, at least by offering a job to someone in the family. 
				Sometimes, there comes a situation for him to suicide, so as to benefit his family with the relief fund sanctioned by the government. But mostly, the funds will be just enough to pay the debts taken from the moneylenders and sometimes it will not be enough even for that. This can be concluded from this story.

		<!--Talk With Onion Dealer-->

			<div class="text-justify">
				<img src="../ASSERTS/talk.jfif" alt="Onion Dealer" width="500px" height="500px" style="float:left;padding-right: 20px;">
				We then went to the onion dealer to whom, Mr. Senthriyan, sell his produce.  We asked him to say about his business as onion dealer. Then he said, “I started this business six years before. This business of buying onions from farmers and selling them to other dealers in the Koyambedu Market gives me a lot of profits. Other small shopkeepers running vegetable shops in and around Chennai, and sell vegetables to customers in their shops buy them from that dealers in Koyambedu Market. I not only run business of buying and selling onions, but also of other vegetables. But, onion is the most specific vegetable I sell during every season.” When he was asked about the price at which he buy and sell the onions, he said, “I will normally buy onions from the farmers at the rate of Rs.10 to Rs.15 per Kg, and sell them to other dealers by adding a little profit of 30% to 40%. As of today, I bought onions at Rs.12 per Kg and sold them at Rs.17 per Kg. It gave me a profit of Rs.5 per Kg.” When we asked him about the prices at which the other dealers to whom he sold, sell to the shopkeepers and the price at which the shopkeeper bought sell to the customer, he said that it would probably be Rs. 25 or Rs.30 per Kg at which the other onion dealers sell them and the shopkeepers sell them at the rate of Rs. 40 to Rs. 55 per Kg, depending on their expenses and the demand in the market.

		<!--Hypothesis-->
		<div id="hypo" class="section">
			<h1>&#x1F9C5 Hypothesis</h1>
			<div class="text-justify">
				Therefore, we can state that, the farmer is the one who is getting the lowest profits among all others to whose hands the onions are getting passed. The onions cannot be grown without the help of the farmer, but he is the one who is getting paid the least amount. Food is the most important component for the survival of human beings, which is being cultivated by the farmer. But no hands are there to help the farmers during the time of need.

			<h1>&#x1F9C5 Solutions</h1>
			<div class="text-justify">
				Some of the solutions to overcome this situation are as listed below:
				<br><br><ul class="solution">
					<li>Both government as well as the common people should take the responsibility to help the farmers during the time of need.</li>
					<li>2% Farmer tax should be imposed on all the food products processed by the farmers and that tax amount collected should be the support for the farmer.</li>
					<li>The farmer should be given support that even when his crop fails, he will be given the suitable money for the produce.</li>
					<li>Direct links between the farmers and the shop keepers or between the farmers and the customers should be made either by the government or the people.</li>
					<li>The farmers should be educated by the people about modern farming methods and various other methods to increase the produce.</li>
					<li>The government should see to that the farmers get paid suitably for the produce.</li>
					<li>The moneylenders and the dealers who exploit the peasants should be punished and the farmers should get aware of these people and stay away from them. </li>
					<li>Farmers should be given loans with 0% interest and free fertilizers and electricity for agriculture.</li>
					<li>The price of the produce should be fixed for that particular crop, taking investment, profits, etc. Into consideration, before the time of sowing itself, which provide support to  the farmers during the time of crop failure, disasters like cyclones or floods that affect the produce.</li>
					<li>The farmers should get aware of the Cold Storage facilities, that help them to sell their produce during the time of increased prices without causing any affect to the produce.</li>
					<li>The Farmers’ market or ‘Ulavar Sandhai’, should be set up in various places, so as to help the farmers to sell their produce directly to the customers at suitable prices.</li>
